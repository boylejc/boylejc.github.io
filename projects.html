            <p class="project_text">
                PCRG has annually compiled a mortgage lending study, examining the mortgage applications and originations for all Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) eligible lenders.
                In addition to the traditional written report that focuses on lending to low- and moderate-income (LMI) borrowers, LMI census tracts, and to minority borrowers - the 
                online data dashboard includes additional information. This includes American Community Survey (ACS) neighborhood profiles, interactable maps, and more. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We found continuing racial disparities that <b>negatively impact Black borrowers in Allegheny County</b> even when comparing for income status, as for many lenders
                the mortgage origination rate was higher for low-income white borrowers than it was for middle- and upper-income Black borrowers. This continues to concentrate many of Allegheny
                County's Black residents into segregated neighborhoods of disadvantage.

                Due to rising concerns from residents and neighborhood community groups, PCRG authored a study measuring 
                the activity of corporate entities (LLCs, Limited Partnerships, and others) in purchasing single-family housing units in Allegheny County from 2010-2021.
                As the lead author of the study, I tracked every housing transaction during that time period and geocoded the address data to fit census tract boundaries to see which 
                neighborhoods, boroughs, and municipalities were most effected by corporate housing purchases. 
    
                <br>
                <br>
    
                PCRG found that there was strong correlation that corporate entities were purchasing single-family housing units specifically in neighborhoods 
                with <b>higher concentrations of minority populations</b> and in <b>low- or moderate-income neighborhoods.</b> We did not determine any causal effects,
