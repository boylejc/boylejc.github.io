        <p class="about_text">
            My name is John Boyle (he/him) and I am a data and research analyst based in Richmond, Virginia. I am a graduate of Virginia Tech 
            (2015, B.A. Political Science) and Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College (2020, M.S. Public Policy and Management).
            My research is typically focused on the intersection between housing policy and racial/economic justice through the use of observational analysis.
            <br>
            <br>
            This career focus came as a result of my Heinz capstone project, 
            sponsored by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services. Our group  two main issues: whether Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood had 
            experienced gentrification and displacement, and if housing voucher recipients were protected from potential displacement. We found that while East Liberty 
            had not met the academic criteria used for gentrification and displacement, it had experienced significant changes that led to a loss of primarily 
            lower income and Black residents. Additionally, we found that voucher recipients were more likely to stay within in the neighborhood, and experience 
            the positive neighborhood changes associated with the academic definition of gentrification.
            <br>
            <br>
            Prior to my work in data analytics and community development, I spent time working it politics. 
            This included a year working in digital publishing for an online media company, one campaign cycle as a field organizer 
            for the Democratic Party of Virginia's 2018 coordinated campaign, and as a Staff Assistant for U.S. Senator Tim Kaine.
            Outside of work, I am a passionate fan of Philadelphia sports, listening to music of all genres (currently listening to emo, alt-rock, and ska -- so please don't judge me),
            and exploring the city of Richmond with my dog, Buddy.

        <p class="about_text">
            Buddy is a three and a half year old Shetland Sheepdog, hailing from Aliquippa, Pennsylvania. The greatest pandemic dog that anyone could ever ask for, 
            Buddy <br>is an absolute professional at chewing sticks, catching <br>and chasing down tennis balls, and barking at phone calls. <br>He loves to howl at firetrucks and other service vehicles, 
            knows a lot of words in English (too many words for his own good?), and wants to know if he can have a little of whatever it is that you're eating at the moment... <br><br>He says it looks delicious.
