            <h2>Greater Richmond Home Values Continue to outpace Income Growth</h2>
            <h5>September 2023</h5>
        
            <p class="list_text">
                Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HDMA) data shows that the median property values for homebuyers are increasing at a rate that is outpacing income growth in the Richmond MSA from 2018 to 2022. This only applies to originated loans (where the median income for homebuyers was nearly $17,000 higher than the $81,400 median household income for the Richmond MSA in 2022), so you can imagine the difficulty that first-time homebuyers and low- or moderate-income (LMI) homebuyers are facing in this market.
                <br>
                <br>
                But there are things we can be doing now at the local level to help with this burden, including:
                <br><br>
                <a href='https://lnkd.in/ezV4jUEC' target="_blank"> 1) Down-payment and closing cost assistance programs, with a particular focus on first-time homebuyers and/or first generation homebuyers.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a href='https://lnkd.in/eiyGcyUV' target="_blank"> 2) Encourage banks to use creative new mortgage products to assist LMI and households by using Special Purpose Credit Programs.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a href='https://lnkd.in/eqnpcv3r' target="_blank"> 3) Expanding homeownership opportunities in conjunction with "development with displacement" practices.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a href='https://lnkd.in/eNJyp5KY' target="_blank"> 4) public investment in affordable housing through bond financing.</a>

            <h2>Community Disadvantage Index<br>Richmond, VA (2021 5-yr Estimates)</h2>
            <h5>September 2023</h5>
        
            <p class="list_text">
                Yesterday was the release of the American Community Survey 1-year estimates for 2022, which got me thinking it is time 
                I better understood my new place of residence: Richmond, VA. Although I ended up looking at the census tract, 
                5-year estimates from 2021, I decided to make a community needs index for Richmond based on a variety of factors 
                like the methodology used by the Allegheny County Department of Human Services Community Needs Index. 
                The variables I included were:
                <br>
                <br>
                &emsp; ·       Single mother led households,
                <br>
                &emsp; ·       Educational attainment for people over the age of twenty-five,
                <br>
                &emsp; ·       Homeownership rate,
                <br>
                &emsp; ·       Tract median family income as a percent of area median income; and,
                <br>
                &emsp; ·       Tract median home value as a percent of the area median home value.
                <br><br>
                
                Unsurprisingly given the history of Richmond, the results speak for themselves. There is a strong correlation between being below average in the variables listed above compared to the tract’s population of Black residents in 2021. While this map focuses just on the City of Richmond, if you extend it to the Greater Richmond Area, the results stay about the same. My goal is to continue to build on this initial analysis by looking more into real estate transactions and mortgage data, but I wanted to start here – even if it isn’t anything groundbreaking.
                <br><br>
                Housing policy is the key to wealth building and remediating the racial and economic inequalities that continue to exist in Richmond. Whether its programs like the WORTH Initiative or looking at deferred home maintenance and repairs, there is so much that can be done here that can make a positive impact without contributing to the region’s massive history of gentrification and displacement.

            <h2>Where Does Pittsburgh Public Transit Go From Here?</h2>
            <h5>August 22, 2023</h5>
      
            <p class="list_text">
                <b>Pre-pandemic Pittsburgh had one of the strongest bus transit systems in the county. 
                Unfortunately, its recovery has been just as slow as the other major transit agencies.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                According to the National Transit Database's raw monthly ridership figures, the Pittsburgh Regional Transit system 
                (formerly the Port Authority of Allegheny County, as it is still referred to in the data) 
                had one of the strongest bus ridership figures per capita in the last full year of data from before the pandemic. 
                Specifically this was looking at transit agencies that: 1) operated in urbanized areas (UZAs) with a total population greater than 500,000; and 2) 
                completed at least 65,000,000 unlinked bus passenger trips from 2002 to June 2023.
                <br>
                <br>
                Of the more than 800 unique transit authorities in the dataset, there were 112 active authorities that fit the above criteria. In 2019, PRT conducted approximately 56,350,000 bus trips, which equates to about 32.3 trips for every resident of the Pittsburgh metro area. That was the fifth highest per capita bus service of 2019, and coming from the smallest metro area in the top 10.
                <br>
                <br>
                </p>
                <div class="center_tableau">
                <iframe title="Pre- and Post-Pandemic Bus Passenger Trips per Capita from Major Transit Agencies" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Ifcj3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Ifcj3/3/" scrolling="yes" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="1154" height="1147" data-external="1"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="list_text">
                <br>
                <br>
                As you can see, even with a 42.5% reduction in bus passengers from pre-pandemic 2019 to 2022, Pittsburgh remains in the top 10 for passenger bus trips per capita. However, this may understate Pittsburgh's public transportation recovery due to the PRT's over-reliance on buses relative to light rail - where Pittsburgh trails heavily in per capita ridership and has had an even more anemic ridership recovery.
                <br>
                <br>
                </p>
                <h5>Why Public Transportation Recovery Matters</h5>
                <br>
                <p class="list_text">
                According to the 2019 American Community Survey Data, about 17% of the workers over the age of 16 within the City of Pittsburgh commuted to work by public transportation. But of those commuted to work on public transportation:
                over half (53.1%) made less than $35,000 a year
                less than a third owned homes (31.8%)
                were predominantly women (57.3%)
                and more likely to work in either the healthcare/education/social services industry (30.5%) or administrative or food services industry (17.3%).<br><br>
                This is critically important to remember when considering the demographics of who has left Pittsburgh in recent years. Recovering to those pre-pandemic levels will be harder as people are pushed further and further from the economic core of Pittsburgh. This will also be made tougher by the significant losses in buses operated by PRT - down almost 40% from 829 vehicles operated in maximum service 2002 to 498 in May 2023.
                <br>
                <br>
                Part of Pittsburgh's existing success in public transportation stems from the fact that it is not solely used by daily workforce commuters. Ridership includes students who attend many of the schools within Pittsburgh, as well as the (albeit-limited) light rail service that primarily connects Downtown Pittsburgh with the stadiums on the North Shore and the residential areas of the South Hills. Having discretionary commuters is a worthy goal of every transportation agency, and one that has shown to reduce the stigmatization of public transportation in the United States.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5>What Can We Do To Assist In This Recovery</h5>
                <p class="list_text">
                    Some cities used grant and pandemic recovery money to test free bus fares with relative success. Notable in the table above: Tucson, AZ has nearly recovered to their pre-pandemic ridership levels while maintaining free fares throughout at least 2023. Smaller city transit agencies like in Richmond, VA and Raleigh, NC have experienced relatively quicker recoveries (although still not to pre-pandemic levels) through free fare systems, while larger transit agencies such as the Denver Regional Transportation District in Denver, CO, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Boston, MA, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York are experimenting with free fare pilot programs to various extents this summer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, work like removing parking minimums and giving preference to transit oriented development can be key to enhancing existing transit systems - and is in line with the work advocated for by organizations like Pittsburghers for Public Transit, BikePGH, and Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group - signatories to Pittsburghers for Public Transit's 100 Days Transit Platform.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While much of this article paints a relatively rosy picture of pre-pandemic public transportation in Pittsburgh, it does not mean that the system was perfect or infallible. Bus bunching is still a major issue, as are equity concerns in the Bus Rapid Transit project for Downtown-Uptown-Oakland such as the removal in the Edgewood/Swissvale area that would no longer be serviced by the P3, or the underutilized light-rail system that operates at less capacity and at higher cost than other light-rail services, and so many other valid and legitimate concerns.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We need to continue to speak up for what is right, continue to push local elected officials on their promises and hold them accountable for their failures, especially with regards to public transportation and housing. But we also need to recognize the strengths that exist within the system, and use a data-informed approach that centers on real human experiences to do so. Hopefully, this article can be a good starting point for some of those discussions as Pittsburgh and Allegheny County head into election season this fall.

        <h2>Examining Housing Affordability in Pittsburgh</h2>
        <h5>August 2023</h5>

        <p class="list_text">
            Even though I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, the Irish Centre development has reminded me that we don't do a great job of discussing what affordability 
            means at a neighborhood/community level and why that matters when housing projects are announced. 
            So I created this map that looks at the median home value relative to the MSA median household income for census tracts in Allegheny County, 
            according to the 2021 American Community Survey data <br>(5-year estimates).
            <br>
            <br>
            At the MSA level, the price-to-income ratio for the median home price to the median income is 2.54, 
            but that isn't true in each census tract. The places that are most affordable are the areas of Allegheny County that are historically 
            redlined and marginalized communities, facing the most disinvestment - <br>which I would add in my opinion is not an accident. 
            Unsurprisingly, these are also the communities that typically saw a lot of population decline from 2010-2020. 
            (For more information, check out Chris Briem's 2020 Census Redistricting Data Extracts on the Western PA Regional Data Center's website.) 
            The most unaffordable places are the suburbs to the north and west of Pittsburgh, <br>as well as the areas in the East End around Pitt and CMU.
            <br>
            <br>
            <iframe title="Affordable Housing for the Median Household in Allegheny County" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-XkjQa" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XkjQa/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="676" height="877" data-external="1"></iframe>
            <br>
            Those neighborhoods/communities in-between are becoming less and less frequent, as neighborhoods like Brookline, Bloomfield, Greenfield, and Garfield are seeing home values go up. The same is true in the county, particularly in the boroughs and townships in the South Hills.

            <h2>A Response to the <br>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</h2>
            <h5>February 2023</h5>
        
            <p class="list_text">
                Just wanted to give a little context towards the quotes that were attributed to Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group in this piece [titled "Study: Black homeownership rate in Pittsburgh remains disproportionately small"]. Penn Hills, Monroeville, Stowe, McKeesport, McKees Rocks, and Turtle Creek all experienced a net increase in Black population, while East Liberty, Lincoln-Lemington, and Garfield lost Black population from the 2010 Census to the 2020 Census.
                <br><br>
                However, these moves (either in or out) are not all equal. At the time I spoke with the author of this article, the latest ACS data was from 2020. I had noted that Penn Hills, Monroeville, and Stowe had seen net increases in Black population AND significant gains in median household income for Black households over the previous 5-year ACS period (Table B19013B on the census data site for those wondering).
                <br><br>
                So much so that the median household income for a Black household in Penn Hills ($52,353), Monroeville ($64,365), or Stowe ($48,642) are nearly twice that of the City of Pittsburgh ($27,365). At the same time, areas like McKeesport ($26,108), McKees Rocks ($24,531), and Turtle Creek ($22,423) saw increases in Black population, but are areas that still below median household income for Black households in Pittsburgh. This is an important distinction.

                Similarly, I would categorize the neighborhoods that experienced significant Black population loss differently. Areas like East Liberty and Upper Lawrenceville, that lost 34.3% and 79.5% of their Black populations respectively, saw clear evidence of gentrification and displacement. Garfield also saw evidence of gentrification and displacement, but not necessarily to the degree or with the amount of media coverage as East Liberty.
                <br><br>
                However, areas like Lincoln-Lemington and Homewood North also experienced significant Black population declines without the noticeable material gains experienced in East Liberty, Lawrenceville, and Garfield.
                <br><br>
                The reason I bring this up is because terms like gentrification and displacement get used a lot in the space, and it can present issues with how we discuss real challenges faced by real families and individuals. I regret that I may not have expressing my ideas correctly when I talked to Tim Grant a couple of months ago. But this is important because a lot of attention is given to communities going through gentrification, while much less attention is given to areas seeing displacement without material change. We should not conflate the two. To do so may ignore the realities of disinvested communities and neighborhoods that are prone to high concentrations of poverty, community violence, and continued racial segregation. These issues affect the movements of populations in the region just as much as housing affordability. No one should have to choose between a safe neighborhood and an affordable neighborhood.
